			<p> Welcome to my profile ! I am Olivia, a young 20 year old student who lives in the south of France in
				Marseille ! For a few years now I have been passionate about the world of web and graphic design,
				spending hours on Canva or even making websites is a real pleasure for me !
				I love travelling and discover new places. Recently I integrated an association in my school and I am in
				the digital pole, all this year I will have to improve the site ! I can't wait ! I let you discover the
				website of my association called Le Citadingue !</p>

			<h2>My experiences
				<hr>
			</h2>

			<p>I did a 6 month internship in a company that sold parapharmaceutical products online called
				Paraselection.com. Thanks to this internship I was able to develop several skills in digital marketing,
				front end, graphic design, community management and project management.
				Finally, this year I joined an association whose aim is to identify the best addresses in Marseille. I
				am at the digital pole, so I have to take care of the website, the application and the social networks.
